# LaTeXCommenter

A very direct and simple tool to compare old and new version of LaTeX documents, with annotation and changes hardcoded in the .tex according to specifications.

+ Please see the [example](https://github.com/SebastianoF/LaTeXCommenter/tree/master/example) for quick start.

+ See also LaTeX packages [latexdiff](https://ctan.org/pkg/latexdiff), [ulem](https://ctan.org/pkg/ulem) and the website https://3142.nl/latex-diff/ for alternatives, where adding comments other than comparing the old and the new version is not needed and to avoid hardcoding the comment in the source file.
