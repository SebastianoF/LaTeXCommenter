## LaTeXCommenter

A very direct and simple tool to compare old and new version of LaTeX documents, with annotation and changes hardcoded in the .tex according to specifications.

Please see the example in the folder.

See also LaTeX packages latexdiff, ulem and the website https://3142.nl/latex-diff/ for alternatives, where adding comments other than comparing the old and the new version is not needed.
